# DailyPost

A social media web app where users can post an image with descriptions, and others can check from the feed. Other users will have an option to like the post, or add the user as their friend. When users become friends with others, they will appear on the friend list. By clicking on the name from the list, they can visit a specific user's profile.

Frontend is hosted on my shared hosting from GlowHost, with backend hosted on Render.com (I tried hosting the backend using my own hosting service as well, but Render.com appears to be slightly faster)
